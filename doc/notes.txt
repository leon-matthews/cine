Notes on the IMDB Text files
============================

The need for Roman numerals follows from the basic database design.
The names and titles themselves are the keys into the data and must be
unique, hence the need for Roman numerals. Other solutions are
possible, but we feel that the current solution is the best for the 
time being and hope this view is also shared by our users.  


Titles
======

The titles in the database fall into one of five categories:

 (1) movies, unless otherwise indicated the title is a movie
 (2) made for TV movies, indicated by a (TV) tag
 (3) made for video movies, indicated by a (V) tag
 (4) TV-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s
 (5) mini-series, indicated by enclosing the title in "'s and a (mini) tag


Filmographies
=============

The filmography databases enable notes on a particular performance/contribution
to be recorded. Each database has a different set of symbols, although some 
overlap where appropriate.

Ratings
=======

The movie ratings report is a massive on-going poll of movies rated on a scale
from 1 (bad) to 10 (excellent) by users on the Internet. An example entry on
the report is:

      0000000115    3314   8.8  Casablanca (1942)

For each movie, the vote distribution, the total number of votes and the 
average rating are shown. The vote distribution uses a single character to 
represent the percentage of votes for each ranking.  The following characters
codes can appear:

     "." no votes cast        "3" 30-39% of the votes  "7" 70-79% of the votes
     "0"  1-9%  of the votes  "4" 40-49% of the votes  "8" 80-89% of the votes
     "1" 10-19% of the votes  "5" 50-59% of the votes  "9" 90-99% of the votes
     "2" 20-29% of the votes  "6" 60-69% of the votes  "*" 100%   of the votes

So, in our example above, "Casablanca" has received a total of 3314 votes, the
average of the votes being 8.8 with 50-59% 10/10; 10-19% 9/10; 10-19% 8/10; 
1-9% 7/10 etc.
