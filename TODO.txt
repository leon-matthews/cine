* Figure out the relationship between readers, database, tables, and importer
  modules.

* Populate central table (titles?)

* Experiment to find the pros and cons of enabling slots for the reader
  dataclasses, ie. ``@dataclass(slots=True)``. This is available only in
  Python 3.10+

* Should TitlePrincipals.characters be a list of strings? The dataset docs
  suggest it should, but the data itself suggests it should not.
