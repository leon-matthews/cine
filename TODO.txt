* Figure out the relationship between readers, database, tables, and importer
  modules.

* Populate central table (titles?)

* Experiment to find the pros and cons of enabling slots for the reader
  dataclasses, ie. ``@dataclass(slots=True)``. This is available only in
  Python 3.10+

  No slots:
    FINISHED 1,396,899 records in 6.637s
    Used 673.0MB of RAM, averaging 505 bytes per record

  With slots:
    1,396,899 records in 7.659s
    Used 664.0MB of RAM, averaging 498 bytes per record

  Something is wrong! That did practically nothing.


* Should TitlePrincipals.characters be a list of strings? The dataset docs
  suggest it should, but the data itself suggests it should not.
