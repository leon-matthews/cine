====

* Figure out the relationship between readers, database, tables, and importer
  modules.

* Populate central table (titles?)

* Experiment with saving memory via slots or other means.

* Should TitlePrincipals.characters be a list of strings? The dataset docs
  suggest it should, but the data itself suggests it should not.
